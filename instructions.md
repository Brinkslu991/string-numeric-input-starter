
# String & Numeric Input in Python

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

> *use the `input( )` function to prompt the user for string input*
>
>  *use the `input( )` function and the float ( ) function to prompt the user for a number Python will treat as a float (floating-point number)*
>
>  *use the `input( )` function and the int ( ) function to prompt the user for a number Python will treat as an integer (a number without a decimal point)*

## Getting Started

- Read instructions and review the project resources
- Create a **public** GitHub repo named: **string-numeric-input-practice**
- Submit the URL that points to your repo on Google Classroom

## General Specifications

- Add a comment block to the top of your Python script, like so:
```python
# Abraham Lincoln
# 24 MAR 20XX
# String & Numeric Input
```
- Use short, descriptive filenames and variable names
- Write your variable names and filenames in lowercase

## Your Tasks

In your `main.py` file, write the following code:

### Task 1
- Use the `input( )` function to prompt the user to enter his/her first name and the name of the program they attend at Career Tech.
- Assign the user's responses to variables
- Use **concatenation** to build an output string that displays the user's answers
- Please use correct capitalization, spelling, and punctuation in your code

### Task 2
- On one line, prompt the user to enter their current age
- Assign their response to a variable `age`
- On the next line of code, use the `int( )` function to convert the user's response to an **integer** (a number that doesn't have a decimal point)
- Display a sentence that contains the user's current age
- Challenge: Have Python add 10 years to the user's current age; then display a sentence that says what the user's age will be ten years from now

### Task 3
- Using the `input( )` and `int ( )` functions in a single line of code, prompt the user to enter the number of people in his/her family
- Use **concatenation** to display a sentence that says how many people are in the user's immediate family
    - HINT: The Python `str(  )` function might come in handy here!
- On the next line of code, use an f-string to display a sentence that says how many people are in the user's immediate family
